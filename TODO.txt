NOTES
- all children of GameManager in ship-select.unity are persistent

[layers]
0	space
1	between space and track (falling)
2	track
3	boost plates / power-ups
4	racers

[Android]
- horizontal is better than vertical
- text is teeeeny
- space lane is easier than sea drive
- controls should be fixed so if left is down then can't go right & vice versa

[Notes]
- shannon times:
	1) 2:39.2
	2) 2:54.93
	3) 11:52+ (gave up)
- focus on wall "braking" as a mechanic? maybe "brake pads" in the ground?"
	- idea: braking is positional, not control
- new racers?
- new tracks?
- new environments?
- map editor!
	- for self at the beginning
- export music as wav and normalize to ogg (don't put wavs in project!)
- what's the point of attacking if there aren't enemy ships?
    - could put attack back in w/ enemy ships but the following ideas should be
      considered - how to control with two buttons?
    - maybe running into enemy ships = destroyed
    - could get a speed boost for hitting them? (nonsense!)
	- charge boost (1+2 while charged)
	- charge jump (1+2 while boosting)
    - could remove strafe entirely and have it do something else like
	- jump over pits
	- charge through obstacles
	- briefly accelerate (miniboost then slow down)
	- later, release as part of package (with user-friendly control)
- start with easier tracks (tutorial a straight loop?)
	- fewer (or no) death areas)
- game story
- drivers art (& design)
- driver backstories / bios
